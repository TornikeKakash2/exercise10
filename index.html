          This is Earth. Earth is the third planet from the Sun and the only
          astronomical ob ject known to harbor life. Th is is enabled by Earth
          being an ocean world, the only one in the Solar System sustaining
          liquid surface water. Almost all of Earth's water is contained in its
          global ocean, covering 70.8% of Earth's crust. The remaining 29.2% of
          Earth's crust is land, most of which is located in the form of
          continental landmasses within Earth's land hemisphere

          This is Mercury. It is the smallest planet in the Solar System, with
          an equatorial radius of 2,439.7 kilometres (1,516.0 mi). Mercury is
          also smaller—albeit more massive—than the largest natural satellites
          in the Solar System, Ganymede and Titan. Mercury consists of
          approximately 70% metallic and 30% silicate material.

          This is Mars. Mars is the fourth planet from the Sun. The surface of
          Mars is orange-red because it is covered in iron(III) oxide dust,
          giving it the nickname "the Red Planet".[21][22] Mars is among the
          brightest objects in Earth's sky, and its high-contrast albedo
          features have made it a common subject for telescope viewing

          This is Neptune. Dark, cold and whipped by supersonic winds, giant
          Neptune is the eighth and most distant major planet orbiting our Sun.
          More than 30 times as far from the Sun as Earth, Neptune is not
          visible to the naked eye. In 2011, Neptune completed its first
          165-year orbit since its discovery.

          This is Pluto. Pluto (minor-planet designation: 134340 Pluto) is a
          dwarf planet in the Kuiper belt, a ring of bodies beyond the orbit of
          Neptune. It is the ninth-largest and tenth-most-massive known object
          to directly orbit the Sun. It is the largest known trans-Neptunian
          object by volume, by a small margin, but is less massive than Eris.

          This is Uranus. Uranus is one of two ice giants in the outer solar
          system (the other is Neptune). Most (80% or more) of the planet's mass
          is made up of a hot dense fluid of "icy" materials water, methane, and
          ammonia above a small rocky core. Near the core, it heats up to 9,000
          degrees Fahrenheit (4,982 degrees Celsius).

          This is Venus. Venus is the second planet from the Sun. It is a
          terrestrial planet and is the closest in mass and size to its orbital
          neighbour Earth. Venus is notable for having the densest atmosphere of
          the terrestrial planets, composed mostly of carbon dioxide with a
          thick, global sulfuric acid cloud cover.

          with an average radius of about nine-and-a-half times that of
          Earth.[26][27] It has only one-eighth the average density of Earth,
          but is over 95 times more massive.
